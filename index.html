                <h3>Hello!</h3>
                <p class="introduction">
                    I am an aspiring software developer currently in a Coding Bootcamp until late August 2022. It is primarily Java based and it was initially a different change of pace from the languages that I had learned such as javascript and python. But, I have since become accustomed to many concepts in java such as test driven design as well as oop features. This experience has reinforced my love of solving problems with coding.

                <h3>Virtual Pet</h3>
                <p>This project was about coding a virtual pet with traits and needs to respond to user inputs. It had basic java operations including collections, arrays, and test driven development. I realized that test driven developement was supposed to be written as one is creating the project as opposed to after the project. As a result of seeing that approach in the hospital, grocerylist walkthroughs, I understood constructors much better. All in all, it was good to see the strides I was making in applying all that I was learning.</p>

                <h3>Virtual Pet Shelter</h3>
                <p>In the sequel to virtual pet, we created a shelter to admit or adopt a pet. The current pets were in a collections and users had  many options such as adopting, admitting, feeding, hydrating the pets while making sure the needs were met.

                <p class=""> The final virtual pet project was a culmination of all the concepts along with APIE (Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation.It included robotic pets whose needs were only oiling and maintenance. </p>
